# Vue TypeScript Assignment

This project relies on the following technologies, frameworks and tools to ensure future scalability and extensibility of the project:

- `Vue 3` with `Composition` API style and TypeScript.
- `create-vue` starter with `Vite` for frontend tooling as the recommended setup for the new `Vue 3` projects in the official Vue documentation.
- `Tailwind` CSS framework for rapid styling. It allows for rapid prototyping of the web projects without design. Only styles which are used in the project are included in the build.
- `Vitest` and `Vue Testing Library` for unit and component tests. These testing libraries are recommended by the official `Vue 3` documentation.
- `ESLint` and `Prettier` for format configuration and automation.
